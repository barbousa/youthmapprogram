# Youth Organization Contract Language

**Mapping Services Contract**

_Updated 4/24/2020_

Agreement between the United States Orienteering Federation, doing business as Orienteering USA \(“OUSA”\) and **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_** \(YOUTH ORGANIZATION\) for participation in the OUSA Youth Mapping Program.

mapping services to be performed by OUSA or its designee for **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_** \(MAP\) in **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**\(MAP LOCATION\) for **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**\(YOUTH ORGANIZATION\).

## GENERAL

Coordination for this Agreement shall be between **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_** YOUTH ORGANIZATION CONTACT, and **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_** COORDINATOR, of the OUSA Youth Mapping Committee \(YMP\).

The goal of this contract is to make an orienteering map of **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\(MAP\)** for use in orienteering education activities.

The map will be made by **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_** \(MAPPER\). OUSA reserves the right to assign a new mapper during the course of the project.

OUSA will assign a MAP CONSULTANT to ensure that the map meets the required specifications and guidelines.

## AGREEMENT

1. Area to be mapped: the area to be mapped is shown in an attachment to this contract, and has a mappable area of **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_** square kilometers.
2. OUSA will supervise and deliver an orienteering map that meets current IOF specifications for orienteering maps, and follows the YMP guidelines as to legend, branding, and other mapping aspects.
   1. OUSA may allow deviations from the specifications and guidelines if they are warranted.
   2. Based on the overall area to be mapped, MAPPER will suggest the suitable scale, contour interval and symbol set to use for the map, following current IOF recommendations for orienteering maps.
   3. Sometimes it is useful to have an additional, larger scale map \(a smaller area with more detail\). Creating this variation requires additional work, and can be provided by the MAPPER if the MAPPER and YOUTH ORGANIZATION can reach agreement on the additional work and price.
   4. The primary data sources will be publicly available Lidar data \(where available\) and/or aerial imagery. If the Lidar data is not publicly available but may be available from a private source, YOUTH ORGANIZATION may be able to obtain that data more easily than the MAPPER.
3. MAPPER will coordinate with YOUTH ORGANIZATION CONTACT, who will carry out the field checking or designate it to another person in the YOUTH ORGANIZATION. YOUTH ORGANIZATION understands that:
   1. Engagement of the YOUTH ORGANIZATION to do the field checking is an important component of the OUSA Youth Mapping Project, because it confirms and deepens the commitment of the YOUTH ORGANIZATION to creation and use of the orienteering map.
   2. If MAPPER is in a position to be on site, then they may assist with field checking, but OUSA will not provide payment for that time, and MAPPER will find additional ways to engage YOUTH ORGANIZATION in using the map.
   3. An inexperienced field checker may result in a less accurate map than would be possible with an experienced field checker. However, OUSA believes that the trade-off, for greater engagement between MAPPER and YOUTH ORGANIZATION, is worth the potentially reduced map accuracy.
4. MAPPER will share a draft version of the map, ready for field work, with YOUTH ORGANIZATION CONTACT and with OUSA, by this date: **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**
5. MAPPER will complete a field-checked map within four weeks of completion of the field work on the part of YOUTH ORGANIZATION CONTACT. This map will include a legend and follow the YMP guidelines for branding. MAPPER will provide this map to OUSA for review by the OUSA-appointed Map Consultant.
6. MAPPER will make changes to the map as requested by the Map Consultant.
7. MAPPER will provide OUSA and the YOUTH ORGANIZATION with final electronic map files in OCAD 12 and PDF file formats, within two weeks of receiving the Map Consultant’s feedback.

## CREDITS

OUSA will retain copyright of the map.

YOUTH ORGANIZATION may use the map without restriction for their own activities, provided any necessary permission is obtained for use of the land. Such activities may include active collaboration with another organization on orienteering education and public events. For all other purposes, including requests by a third party to use or purchase the map, requests must be sent to OUSA.

The credit section of the map will contain the name of the MAPPER. YOUTH ORGANIZATION agrees that this credit will appear on subsequent editions of the map and in any reproduction of the map. This provision will lapse if subsequent editions of the map include substantial revisions based on new field work.

## FEES

The cost of the map is $**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**. This fee covers the costs for MAPPER, MAP CONSULTANT, and administrative fees.

OUSA will provide a grant to cover $**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_** of the cost.

MAPPER will donate professional services worth $**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**.

The remaining $**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_** will be paid by YOUTH ORGANIZATION to OUSA upon notification that the map is finished.

In the event of an intractable disagreement between YOUTH ORGANIZATION and OUSA over the quality or progress of the contracted work, a mutually agreeable arbitrator shall be chosen to render judgment which will be binding on both parties.

## PAYMENT

OUSA shall invoice the YOUTH ORGANIZATION upon receipt of the final map files from MAPPER. YOUTH ORGANIZATION shall pay OUSA the total amount due within 2 weeks of receiving the invoice. OUSA shall provide the final electronic map files to YOUTH ORGANIZATION within two weeks of receiving payment.
