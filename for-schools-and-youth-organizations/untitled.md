# Information for Schools and Youth Organizations

A mapper in the OUSA YMP will be creating a map for your organization and your students. The focus of this program is small schoolyard and urban park maps, with an area less than 1 km^2 \(&lt;250 acres\),  for teaching beginning orienteering to children and youths. For larger maps we recommend talking to the OUSA Mapping  Coordinator. Please make sure to read through the rubrics "Cost" and "Grant Rubric" for more information on the cost to a youth organization for a map, as well as how grants are prioritized.

With the mappers working remotely and rarely being in a position to actually visit the site they are mapping, the program needs at least one enthusiastic person helping with getting the map to the best it can be, and that process is called "Field-checking". You will be able to engage one person or as many students as you want in that process, while following instructions from your mapper.

The mapper will create a map draft by using as many technological tools they have available, like high resolution images, GIS data as well as fun tools like Google Earth Street View to guess or "see" the things at your site. They will then need pairs of eyes and legs to actually go and check out specific items that the mapper thinks they "see" from afar. In addition, they will need help with consistency in mapping, e.g., if water fountains are marked, you will be asked to help spot whether any of them have been missed.

Before engaging with the mapper it will thus be useful to familiarize all who will be participating in the field-checking process at your site with the international map symbols in the form of a legend [cheat sheet](https://www.maprunner.co.uk/iof-control-descriptions/) \(colored symbols are found on the maps, the black symbols are "Control Descriptions"\). 

If not an orienteer, you may be intrigued by some of the terms and what you would want to look for, and it may thus be useful to take a look at the sketches in the [International Control Descriptions](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21AJNtYrZLRCWuyhc&cid=663580750D0C0BCE&id=663580750D0C0BCE%2118465&parId=663580750D0C0BCE%2118466&o=OneUp) \(specifically those small sketches/pictures showing what, e.g., a re-entrant may look like, or a small gully, etc.\). It also helps with the mapper being able to use orienteering vocabulary for items a geography teacher, cadet or scout leader would maybe call something else.

If the map will be of a small area \(large scale\), you may further check out the blog on [international school orienteering symbols](https://ocad.com/blog/2020/02/symbol-set-for-school-orienteering-maps/) as it may give you ideas what cool things are on your school grounds that could be mapped.
