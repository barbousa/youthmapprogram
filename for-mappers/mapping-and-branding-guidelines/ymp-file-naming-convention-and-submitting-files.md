# YMP File Naming Convention and Submitting Files

Maps created through the YMP will be stored on an OUSA shared drive “OUSA Maps” and will be organized into folders for every US state as 2-letter-state-code \[ST\]. The maps created and possibly updated later, plus background files or any other files submitted for a site \(school, small park, etc.\) or park will be stored in the same folder.

Sub-Folder Naming Convention: ST\_County\_MapName

* The “\_County\_” name helps to quickly see how many other maps may be located nearby, within the same county. The “\_MapName” should reflect the location, like a school name or park name and match the map name as stated on the red bar at the top edge of a map.

Map Naming Convention: ST\_County\_MapName\_Scale\_YMPProjectMapperNumber\_xxx

* The “\_YMPProjectMapperNumber” includes the project number as well as the number assigned to an YMP mapper, and identifies the year in which the project was assigned by the YMP Committee. 
* “\_xxx” optional, for example, if a large school district has one project number, with a 1:4,000 map, but additional 1:1,000 maps were made, e.g., for the \_ElemSchool and one for the \_AthleticFieldsComplex.
* Other than the 2-letter state codethings like county and map name should not be abbreviated, as abbreviations make searching for maps of certain locations far more difficult

Submitting Files

* Provide to OUSA YMP a full-feature \(at least OCAD 12\) version of the map file with linked background maps. If the map is drawn in OOM, use “Save As” to create the OCAD file of highest available file version and submit that.
* Independent of the mapping software and version used, create an OCADv12 file version, the latest version with full feature support across common programs \(OCAD, OpenOrienteeringMapper, CONDES, PurplePen, etc\). For this file ensure that:
  * All background maps have been deleted
  * Delete all draft symbols
  * No symbols are hidden
  * Ensure map is in “Normal” mode rather than draft or transparent.
* Submit all relevant background map files

Recommended

* Provide relevant background map files \(e.g. LiDAR hillshade\) and geo-referencing information \(“world” files…e.g. Hillshade.tif and Hillshade.tfw\) to assist future map updates.
* Create a PDF of the map and any intended blow-up scales for beginners \(including appropriate lay-out elements—“real estate” on the paper of a beginner blow-up is at a premium\).
