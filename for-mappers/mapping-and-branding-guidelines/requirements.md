# Summary

Please become familiar with all of the [Mapping and Branding Guidelines](./).

This page is a summary of the key expectations from those guidelines. Please check in with the YMP Committee if you want to make any changes to these guidelines for your project. Feel free to consult the YMP Map Consultant at any stage of this project with questions.

* Map scale and symbol set
  * Fit on Letter paper.
  * Include branding, legend, explanatory text, title, copyright, version date, and other key elements.
  * Scale should be appropriate for the project; typically 1:1000 - 1:4000; see the [Map Scale OCAD Wiki](http://www.ocad.com/wiki/ocad/en/index.php?title=Map_Scale).
  * Use good safety bounding.
  * Primary data sources are usually Lidar data and aerial imagery.
  * Use the [School Symbols Set](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1d78h3VbOU2HGStS5Az5sGnGlt8sa-nuL) or [ISSprOM](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1i7PtcerhTtEjQwOKJvAeUK18GIZUsszi) from IOF.
* Map guidelines
  * Use OCAD 12+ or OOM \(saved as OCAD files\).
  * Geo-reference in UTM coordinates.
  * Use proper relationships for vertex features.
  * Follow IOF legibility and orientation requirements.
  * Follow guidelines for magnetic north lines spacing and legibility.
  * The map should not show flaws at blown-up scales \(which are likely to be used in teaching\).
* Layout and branding: Use our sample OCAD files for standard look and feel.
* Map information meta-data: Provide the elements we require.
* Use our file naming convention and know the submission procedures.
