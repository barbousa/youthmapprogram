[Guidelines and Expectations for Youth Map Program Projects](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1p6MBeOFRCvZIs7udnhbcaWnBeorifWD96uoiZp1pABE)

Maps for the YMP program should meet these expectations:

1. Meet the [ISSprOM standard](http://baoc.org/wiki/images/a/ac/ISSprOM_2019.pdf), with the [ISSOM school symbol set add-on](https://drive.google.com/a/orienteeringusa.org/file/d/1Ez6hZKwhSzUAl1o4iCP3JcG4f068phP1/view?usp=sharing). Reasonable deviations may be allowed with a good rationale. General reference: [https://orienteering.sport/iof/mapping/](https://orienteering.sport/iof/mapping/)
2. Use a scale appropriate for the project; typically this would range between 1:1000 and 1:4000.
3. Use a template \(to be decided\) for a standard “look and feel” with OUSA branding.
4. Provide a legend
5. Include a scale bar, but not a scale \(like “1:4000”\). Often schools end up printing the map at different scales, either on purpose or accidentally, and the scale bar will remain correct.
6. We expect maps to be done in OCAD or OOM. Can maps be converted between the two applications easily?
7. Copies of the completed map should go to OUSA, and those involved in the map creation \(base map, field checker, updater, and so on\), as well as the youth organization making the request. 
8. Map copyright should be on the map. Copyright will be held by OUSA if the youth organization received a grant. Copyright will be held by the YO otherwise.

The mapper should put a copy of the map on World of O, and make sure that the copyright owner is aware that this is being done. How does one get a copy of the map on World of O?
