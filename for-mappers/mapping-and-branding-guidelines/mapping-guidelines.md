# Mapping Guidelines

1. Maps are expected to be drawn in OCAD 12 or higher or in OOM with symbology in accordance with current IOF standards. Reasonable deviations may be allowed with a good rationale. Ultimately, maps drawn in OOM should be saved and submitted as OCAD files \(whatever highest available version for saving\).
2. It is recommended to set up the map geo-referenced in UTM coordinates.
3. Magnetic north lines should be spaced 120 meters on 1:4,000 maps, cut appropriately to maintain legibility \(e.g. crossing same color symbols or when obscuring point features\).
4. Map drafting flaws are not evident at blown-up scales typically used for beginner courses \(ISOM: 5k, ISSprOM 3k\). 
5. Layout objects are clean and easy to read. Please don't use the layout object layer of OCAD as it may not be compatible with OOM or older versions of OCAD. Put all layout objects and logos in the main symbol layer of OCAD.

Follow IOF legibility and orientation requirements:

* Vertex \(normal, corner, dash\) of linear features shows proper relationship
* Trails join at the center of black dashes while indistinct trail junction symbols do not connect
* Trail / stream crossings indicate the presence/absence of a footbridge.
* Side symbols for walls and fences avoid breaking at corners.
* Contours are \(virtually\) cut when crossing small ditches \(brown dots\), pits \(brown Vs\), depressions \(brown Us\), knolls,and earth banks  if they can not sensibly deviate around them.
* Minimum gaps between symbols of the same color
* Area feature minimum size and width maintained
* Line feature minimum size maintained
* Point features that are required to be oriented to Magnetic North \(V pits, U depressions, etc.\) ensured
* LiDAR contours appear smooth
* Border lines between area features do not have gaps \(typically white\)
