Mapper Contract                 

Updated 9/28/2020                                      

Agreement between The United States Orienteering Federation, Inc., doing business as Orienteering USA \(“OUSA”\) and %MAPPER% \(MAPPER\), %MAPPER EMAIL%, for mapping services to be performed by MAPPER for %MAP% \(MAP LOCATION\) in %LOCATION%, %STATE%, for %YOUTH ORGANIZATION% \(YOUTH ORGANIZATION\).

## GENERAL

Coordination for this Agreement shall be between %MAPPER%, MAPPER and %COORDINATOR%, COORDINATOR, of the OUSA Youth Mapping Committee \(YMP\). 

For purposes of carrying out the work, MAPPER will communicate with contact  %YO CONTACT% of %YOUTH ORGANIZATION% \(YOUTH ORGANIZATION CONTACT\).

This contract is contingent upon OUSA signing a contract with the YOUTH ORGANIZATION for creation of the map. MAPPER should not begin work on the map until COORDINATOR has confirmed that contract is in place. 

MAPPER’s work will be checked by and delivered to %CONSULTANT%, the MAP CONSULTANT assigned by the OUSA YMP. OUSA reserves the right to change the MAP CONSULTANT assignment as needed.

The purpose of this contract is to make an orienteering map of MAP LOCATION for use in outdoor education activities, serving the larger goal of expanding access to orienteering education for children and youth. 

For the purposes of this Agreement, MAPPER shall be an independent contractor and not an employee of the OUSA.  MAPPER shall be responsible for all federal, state and local income taxes and other taxes payable as a result of compensation for work completed under this agreement. MAPPER is responsible for his or her own health insurance and as an independent contractor is not covered by Workman’s Compensation Insurance.

## SCOPE OF WORK

1. Area to be mapped: the area to be mapped is shown in an attachment to this contract, and has a mappable area of %AREA% square kilometers. 
2. MAPPER will create an orienteering map that meets current IOF specifications for orienteering maps, and follows the YMP map guidelines. 
   1. MAPPER may apply to the YMP Committee for dispensation to deviate from the IOF specifications and YMP guidelines; the YMP Committee will consider MAPPER’s rationale and make a determination. 
   2. Based on the overall area to be mapped, MAPPER will suggest the suitable scale, contour interval and symbol set to use for the map, following current IOF recommendations for orienteering maps. 
   3. Sometimes it is useful to have an additional, larger scale map \(a smaller area with more detail\). Creating this variation requires additional work, and can be provided by the MAPPER if the MAPPER and YOUTH ORGANIZATION can reach agreement on the additional work and price. 
   4. The primary data sources will be publicly available Lidar data \(where available\) and/or aerial imagery. If the Lidar data is not publicly available but may be available from a private source, YOUTH ORGANIZATION may be able to obtain that data more easily than the MAPPER.  
3. MAPPER will obtain the necessary software and equipment needed for carrying out the work.
4. MAPPER is not required to visit the site, and may do all of the work remotely. MAPPER will coordinate with YOUTH ORGANIZATION CONTACT, who will carry out the field checking or designate the field checking to another person in the YOUTH ORGANIZATION. MAPPER understands that:
   1. Engagement of the YOUTH ORGANIZATION to do the field checking is an important component of the OUSA Youth Mapping Project, because it confirms and deepens the commitment of the YOUTH ORGANIZATION to creation and use of the orienteering map. 
   2. If MAPPER is in a position to be on site, then they may conduct a site visit as part of draft map preparation. 
   3. If MAPPER is in a position to be on site, then they may assist with field checking, and MAPPER will find additional ways to engage the YO in creating and using the map. 
   4. Expenses for any site visit\(s\) are already included as part of the map completion fees elsewhere in the contract. 
   5. An inexperienced field checker may result in a less accurate map than would be possible with an experienced field checker. However, OUSA believes that the trade-off, for greater engagement between MAPPER and YOUTH ORGANIZATION, is worth the potentially reduced map accuracy.
5. MAPPER will share a draft version of the map, ready for field checking, with YOUTH ORGANIZATION CONTACT and with the OUSA-appointed CONSULTANT, by this date: %DRAFT DATE%
6. MAPPER will complete a field-checked map within four weeks of completion of the field work on the part of YOUTH ORGANIZATION CONTACT. This map will include a legend and follow the YMP guidelines for branding. MAPPER will provide this map to OUSA for review by the OUSA-appointed CONSULTANT.
7. MAPPER will make changes to the map as requested by CONSULTANT.
8. MAPPER will provide OUSA with final electronic map files in OCAD 11 or higher and PDF file formats, within two weeks of receiving CONSULTANT’s feedback. 
9. MAPPER will provide OUSA with a time accounting of their work, broken down by hours \(or parts thereof\) in these categories: information collection and processing \(LiDAR, imagery, geo-spatial data like OSM, etc\), drafting of draft map, site visits \(if any\), post-field-check drafting, map consultant edits, other \(layout/framing, legend creation, documentation, etc\).  

## CREDITS

MAPPER will not retain ownership or copyright of the final map. 

COMPLIANCE

MAPPER represents that he or she is authorized to carry out this work under applicable state and federal laws. If the MAPPER is being paid for some or all of this work, then MAPPER will fill out and send to OUSA a W-9 form \(if MAPPER is a U.S. person including a resident alien or a U.S. company\) or a W-8BEN \(if MAPPER is a foreign person who is working completely outside the U.S.A.\). The form will be sent to OUSA prior to commencing work. 

## FEES

Upon completion of the map, MAPPER will bill OUSA for their services, up to a maximum of $%FEE%. If MAPPER donates any of their services, they may request a letter from OUSA for tax purposes acknowledging donation of professional services. The upper limit on the total value of paid and donated services shall be $%FEE%. No payment will be made, nor will services be considered to be donated, until the map is completed and approved by CONSULTANT.   


There is no payment for field checking, which should be done by YOUTH ORGANIZATION. 

## BREACH OF CONTRACT

Because OUSA has an obligation to YOUTH ORGANIZATION to provide the map, this contract shall be considered null and void, and no payment shall be made, in the following cases:

* MAPPER does not provide the work products by the deadlines stated in this contract, or
* The map does not meet the requirements in item \(2\) of the SCOPE OF WORK.

In the event of an intractable disagreement between MAPPER and OUSA over the quality or progress of the contracted work, a mutually agreeable arbitrator shall be chosen to render judgment which will be binding on both parties.

## PAYMENT

MAPPER shall provide an invoice and time accounting along with the electronic map files. OUSA shall pay MAPPER the total amount within 4 weeks after the final electronic map files are presented to OUSA, provided Map Consultant has confirmed that they meet all requirements.
