# Grant Rubric

Maps over 1 km^2 are not suitable for this program, because we focus on small schoolyard and urban park maps for teaching beginning orienteering to children. Instead, we recommend talking to the OUSA Mapping  Coordinator about programs that may exist for larger maps.

#### Rubric for grants and prioritizing mapping projects

The main considerations are the following:

* Is the applicant a representative of a school or non-profit youth-serving organization? We do not accept applications from orienteering clubs. Clubs are advised to reach out to the OUSA Mapping Contact.
* How well does the project advance the goal of introducing more young people to orienteering? Specifically, how many children and youth will be introduced to orienteering using this map in the next year? Provide specific plans for creating these opportunities.
* How many total young people \(including those who already orienteer, such as JROTC groups\) will use this map for orienteering in the next year? Please provide evidence.
* Is the YO in touch with a local orienteering club or other advising body that will help implement an orienteering program using this map? \(We are happy to provide help if there is no local club.\)
* The Mapper may be remote, and is not required to visit the site. Has the YO identified a person at the school who will work with the Mapper to ensure that it is correct? There is no compensation for this map checking work; this is one of the ways we encourage the YO to be invested in the map. 
* Geographic distribution of maps. We would like maps all over the country. Conversely, it may be useful to have a critical mass of local maps so educators in different nearby schools can work together on inter-school programming.
* Smaller maps suitable for beginner instruction are preferred
* Is the YO willing to pay the $50 fee \(at minimum\)?
* Are there any mappers willing to take on this project? Mappers need to sign up to be a YMP Mapper, and should be familiar with the YMP Mapping Guidelines.

Please note that assignments are not first-in-first-out. We rely on the considerations as laid out above.
