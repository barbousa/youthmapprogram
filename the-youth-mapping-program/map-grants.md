# Map Grants

#### **Financials**

The cost for a map is $2000/km^2, with a minimum of $500. 

The income is split as follows:

* 80% to the mapper
* 10% to the map consultant
* 10% to OUSA as an administrative fee

Grants may cover some or all of the 90% for the mapper and map consultant. The 10% fee must be paid by the YO. We do allow mappers to donate some or all of their time, and this may count toward the 90% of the cost; however, the YO still must pay the 10% fee.

Maps over 1 km^2 are not suitable for this program. Instead, we recommend talking to the OUSA Mapping  Coordinator about programs that may exist for larger maps.

#### Rubric for grants and prioritizing mapping projects

The main considerations are the following:

* Is the applicant a representative of a school or non-profit youth-serving organization? We do not accept applications from orienteering clubs.
* How well does the project advance the goal of introducing more young people to orienteering? Specifically, how many children and youth will be introduced to orienteering using this map in the next year? Provide specific plans for creating these opportunities.
* How many total young people \(including those who already orienteer, such as JROTC groups\) will use this map for orienteering in the next year? Please provide evidence.
* Is the YO in touch with a local orienteering club or other advising body that will help implement an orienteering program using this map?
* Has the YO identified a person at the school who will do the field checking? There is no compensation for field checking; this is one of the ways we encourage the YO to be invested in the map.
* Geographic distribution of maps
* Smaller maps suitable for beginner instruction are preferred
* Is the YO willing to pay the 10% fee \(at minimum\)?
* Are there any mappers willing to take on this project?

Please note that assignments are not first-in-first-out. We rely on the considerations as laid out above.
