# Overview of the Program

Please see the [information page at the Orienteering USA website](https://orienteeringusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/OUSA-Orienteering-Map-Program-for-Schools-and-Non-Profit-Youth-Orgs.pdf).

Our goal is to make it easy for any school or non-profit youth-serving organization in the United States to get a standard orienteering map and/or isometric drawing made of their school or nearby park to help in teaching orienteering. OUSA will take information from mappers and schools, and match them up, and further pair them with a YMP map consultant.

Organizationally, the purpose of this program is threefold:

1. To spread orienteering to as many youth as possible
2. To develop a self-sustaining process to match youth-serving non-profit organizations desiring maps with orienteering mappers and to provide a limited number of grants for map development
3. To provide a forum to share mapping practices and develop professional collaboration among our growing population of mappers
