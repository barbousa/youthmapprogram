# Map Consultants

Our goal is to have a map consultant for each map, who provides advice to the mapper on request. The map consultant will provide feedback to the mapper before the map is finalized. Map consultants should consider the guidelines herein in their feedback and provide recommendations for quality or process improvement. Any recommendations that may benefit other mappers should be shared in the mappers’ forum \([ympmappers@orienteeringusa.org](mailto:ympmappers@orienteeringusa.org)\). 

Mappers are also encouraged to share their progress directly on the mappers’ forum for advice and feedback from other mappers.
