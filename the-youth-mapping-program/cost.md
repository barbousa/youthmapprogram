# Cost

The cost to a Youth Organization of a map \(the Map Creation Fee\) is the sum of \(starting with Round 2\): $1600/km^2 \(minimum $400\) + $100.

The $1600/km^2 goes to the Mapper; $50 is for the Map Consultant, and $50 is an administrative fee. 

The Mapper and the Map Consultant may donate some or all of their professional services to the OUSA Youth Mapping Program, instead of being paid. This helps to sustain our program and create more maps.

The YMP Committee may award a grant to cover some or all of the cost of the mapper and map consultant. The grant never covers the $50 administrative fee, which must be paid by the Youth Organization when the Mapper is assigned to the project. 

We do allow mappers or map consultants to donate some or all of their time to OUSA. If a Mapper or Map Consultant is willing to donate some or all of their time for a particular mapping project, the YMP Committee may take this into consideration when giving grants. 

Mapper volunteering and costs to Youth Organization are not directly related. It may happen that a school pays $500 for a map, the mapper donates their time, and the Map Creation Fee goes into the OUSA Youth Mapping Program for future grants to other organizations.
