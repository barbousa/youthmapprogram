# Remote Mappers and Field Checking

We expect that most mappers will not visit the site themselves. We want the mappers to work with someone from the YO who will do the field checking. While this means that you may be working with a field checker who is not skilled in the art of field checking, the upside is that there is increased engagement and investment on the part of the YO. We feel the tradeoff between map accuracy and YO engagement is worth it.



* In order for a mapper to successfully communicate with an inexperienced field checker, possibly even a YO representative inexperienced in orienteering, a mapper should make sure the YO field checker \(FC\) has access to
  * a copy of the ISSprOM symbols sheet
  * the School set symbols if used for the map
  * the [International Control Descriptions](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21AJNtYrZLRCWuyhc&cid=663580750D0C0BCE&id=663580750D0C0BCE%2118465&parId=663580750D0C0BCE%2118466&o=OneUp) \(specifically those small sketches/pictures showing what, e.g., a re-entrant may look like, or a small gully, etc.\)
  * Map symbol - control description [cheat sheet](https://www.maprunner.co.uk/iof-control-descriptions/) \(not yet available for ISSprOM 2019\)
* The mapper can provide KMZ files to the FC checker, in addition to detailed descriptions of what to verify.
* Useful tools for remote mapping and directing field checkers:
  * use of Strava Heat map to be able to "guess" existence of additional trails in forested areas, maybe not visible in the hill shade, so as to send field checker there to check
  * use of Karttapullautin for Knoll \(= boulder, root stock, junk, etc.\), and cliff \(=earth bank, place under bridges, walls\) generation to help direct field checker to check out specific things, even if not visible in orthoimages
  * use of noisy lidar areas to have field checker verify seasonal or non-seasonal marshy areas
  * given that these are often urban, smaller areas, use of GE Street View to take a "second" look at things near roads that the field checker could then check out.
