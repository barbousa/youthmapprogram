# Remote Mappers and Field Checking

We expect that most mappers will not visit the site themselves. We want the mappers to work with someone from the YO who will do the field checking. While this means that you may be working with a field checker who is not skilled in the art of field checking, the upside is that there is increased engagement and investment on the part of the YO. We feel the tradeoff between map accuracy and YO engagement is worth it.
