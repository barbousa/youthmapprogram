# Communication with YO and YMP Committee

Communications about the program should go to [ympcommittee@orienteeringusa.org](mailto:ympcommittee@orienteeringusa.org)

At the beginning of the project, the mapper should communicate their projected timeline for finishing the map to both the YO and YMP Committee.

The mapper should provide status updates at least once a month until the project is completed.

The mapper should confirm with the YO the name and contact information for the YO-provided field checker at the start of the project. It is important that the YO provide the field checker, because this is an opportunity to further engage the YO. If the mapper does the field checking him/herself, then we lose that engagement opportunity. 

The mapper is encouraged to talk with the YO about ideas for using the map, and to follow up to see how it is going.
