# Map Consultant Information

OUSA YMP Committee will choose a set of map consultants. 

As of 4/22/2020, Bill Cusworth is our first map consultant. Jon Campbell has been added as our second map consultant. We have other people in mind but need to confirm with them.

Consideration for including a map consultant into the map consultant group:

* Experience making maps that have been used for White, Yellow, Sprint events, and educational purposes.
* Effective and positive communicator

Responsibilities

* Map Consultant Group Member
  * Carry out consulting assignments
  * Stay in communication with Map Consultant Group Leader
  * Apply the map naming convention to name the map
  * Store the map where it should go in OUSA's online storage location
  * Publish the map where we have agreed to publish it \(e.g., OrienteeringUSA website\).
* Map Consultant Group Leader\(s\) 
  * Communicate with YMP about any issues that arise
  * Stay in touch with the other map consultants and provide support
  * Keep an eye on communications in the YMP Mappers google group to ensure that conversations are on track and information provided is correct.

Remuneration

* For each mapping project, $50 is available to pay eligible map consultants. Map consultants may choose to waive this fee. Consultants who waive this fee will get a letter from OUSA thanking them for the donation of their professional services.
