# YMP Folder and File Naming Convention

Maps created through the YMP will be stored on an OUSA shared drive “OUSA Maps” and will be organized into sub-folders for every US state as 2-letter state codes \[ST\] and another sub-folder in each state for county. The maps created and possibly updated later, plus background files or any other files submitted for a site \(school, small park, etc.\) will be stored in the same folder. Map Consultants should create sub-folders on the OUSA shared drive using the following convention. The Map Consultant should also ensure that the Mapper has used the correct Map Naming Convention.

Sub-Folder Naming Convention: ST-&gt;County-&gt;YMPProjectMapperNumber\_MapName

* The State sub-folder is a 2-letter state code.
* The County sub-folder helps to quickly see how many other maps may be located nearby, within the same county. 
* The “\_YMPProjectMapperNumber” includes the project number as well as the number assigned to an YMP mapper, and identifies the year in which the project was assigned by the YMP Committee. 
* The “\_MapName” should reflect the location, like a school name or park name and match the map name as stated on the red bar at the top edge of a map.

Map Naming Convention: Date\_Map Name\_Scale\_xxx

* Date is in the format YYYY\_MM\_DD, e.g. "2020\_06\_03".
* Map Name should not be abbreviated, as abbreviations make searching for maps of certain locations far more difficult. Usually the name of the school or park.
* Scale is in the format "4000scale".
* “\_xxx” is optional to be used if for example, a large school district has one project number, with a 1:4,000 map, but additional 1:1,000 maps were made, e.g., for the \_ElemSchool and one for the \_AthleticFieldsComplex.
